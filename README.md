# PlayChess
In this project, ChessPlay, I have created a complete chess front-end application that enables two users to play chess simultaneously on the same website. I built this project using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap CSS, Sassy CSS, and JavaScript. Continuous improvements will be made to enhance the project.
